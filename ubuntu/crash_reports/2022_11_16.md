# Broke Kenzae Linux 

I broke the system by trying to installed old versions of packages kept by `apt`.
The command that broke the system is:
```shell
sudo apt install appstream apt apt-utils at-spi2-core breeze breeze-cursor-theme bubblewrap clang coreutils cron dbus dbus-user-session dbus-x11 debugedit deja-dup dpkg duplicity
```

TODO
roll back all those packages and pray for it to work! lol
