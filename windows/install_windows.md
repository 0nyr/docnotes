# Install Windows

The following describes how to install Windows (11) to a new **TUDEDO InfinityBook Pro 16 Gen 7** computer. This asumes that a *NTFS* partition has already been created prior to the Windows installation. You can use a tool like **GParted** from a Live Ubuntu USB stick to partition the new disk.

1. First, you need to install the Windows `.iso` file to a USB stick. From a windows, type `download windows`, and download the windows wizard. Plug in the stick, then execute the wizard, select the key and download Windows to the key through the wizard. On linux, download directly the windows `.iso` file from Microsoft website.
2. Plug the new Windows key in the new computer. Restart the computer. On the BIOS/UEFI, select the USB stick so that the new computer will start to load the OS from the stick instead of the hard drive. You should see the Windows installation wizard. You should be prompted to enter a valid Windows Key.
3. Buy a new windows key. You can go to websites like **Rakuten**, where a Windows Pro key is only about 1$.
4. Go back to the installation wizard and enter the Windows key.
5. Follow the installation wizard.
6. Download Firefox through Edge. Connect to Firefix account and BitWarden to get back the passwords of many accounts.
7. Time to get additional drivers. On a new TUXEDO computers, the touchpad won't work out of the box, so go to TUXEDO computers website. Login. At the bottom of the home page, in the section *Help & Support*, go to *Downloads & Drivers*. Search for the model of the computer, here **InfinityBook Pro 16 Gen 7**. Download 1 by 1 all the drivers, manually extract them and run all *Application* (`.exe`) files. This step is rather long since you will have to reboot quite a lot of time. 
8. Once all TUXEDO drivers have been installed, go to **Tous les Drivers** websites. Install the scanner, run it and download and install all missing drivers to the computer. Reboot.
9. Go to **Ninite** website to bulk download a bunch of useful softwares like **Thunderbird**, **Steam** and **Google Chrome**. Do the updates if necessary. 
10. Don't forget to setup Thunderbird for the emails.
